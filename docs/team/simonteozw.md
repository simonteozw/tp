# Simon Teo - Project Portfolio

## PROJECT: TrackIt@NUS

This portfolio aims to document the contributions that I have made to the **TrackIt@NUS** project. The Github Link to
 **TrackIt@NUS** can be found [here](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W13-4/tp).
 
## Overview

**TrackIt@NUS** is a desktop application to provide a simple an easy way for students to manage their academic and
 social life. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java.

## Summary of Contributions

### Major Enhancement: Implemented Task Manager

* **What it does:** It allows users to manage their tasks by adding, editing, and deleting tasks. It also allows
 users to view tasks by date and by module.
* **Justification:** Tasks are an integral part of any student's life. Hence, this feature is essential to the app
, enabling students to keep track of all the tasks they have so far.
* **Highlights:** The implementation was challenging and time consuming as it required understanding existing commands within Address Book 3.

### Major Enhancement: Implemented additional Storage classes

* **What it does:** Building upon the original AB3, TrackIt@NUS also allows users to manage modules, tasks, and
 lessons. Hence, additional storage classes were needed to ensure that all these different objects could be stored
  safely in Json.
* **Justification:** All these additional classes were necessary to enable users to manage their student lives in a
 single app. Hence, they also needed to stored efficiently.
* **Highlights:** The implementation was challenging because some the fields in these classes were optional. Hence
, we had to store them as null. Because, we had to be very careful when writing our getters and setters so as to
 minimise all instances of handling null objects and build good abstractions.

### Minor Enhancement: Added Test cases for Task Manager

Because I was the one who implemented the Task Manager and all its related methods, I was responsible for writing the
 test cases of the Task Manager as well.
 
### Minor Enhancement: Added Test cases for Storage classes

* Because I was the one who implemented the additional storage classes and all their related methods, I was responsible
 for writing the test cases of those additional classes as well.
