## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

Welcome to the **TrackIt@NUS** user-guide!

Do you want to balance schoolwork and having a social life, but dislike having to use 3 different
 apps to keep track of everything? Then look no further! TrackIt@NUS is a one-stop solution for busy students like you
  and I.

TrackIt@NUS is a desktop app for managing modules, lessons, tasks, and contacts, tailored to the needs of NUS students and
  optimized for use via a **Command Line Interface (CLI)** while still having the benefits of a **Graphical User
   Interface (GUI)**. If you can type fast, you will be able to manage your academic and social commitments much faster
    than by using other traditional GUI apps.

What are you waiting for? Head on to [Section 2, **Quick Start**](#quick-start) to learn more!
