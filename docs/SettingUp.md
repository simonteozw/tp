## Before writing code

### Configuring the Coding Style

   If using IDEA, follow the guide [_[se-edu/guides] IDEA: Configuring the code style_](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/checkstyle.html) to set up IDEA's coding style to match ours.

 :bulb: Optionally, you can follow the guide [_[se-edu/guides] Using Checkstyle_](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/checkstyle.html) 
 to find how to use the CheckStyle within IDEA e.g., to report problems as you write code.

1. **Set up CI**

   This project comes with a GitHub Actions config files (in `.github/workflows` folder). When GitHub detects those files, it will run the CI for your project automatically at each push to the `master` branch or to any PR. No set up required.

1. **Learn the design**

   When you are ready to start coding, we recommend that you get some sense of the overall design by reading about
    [TrackIt@NUS's architecture](DeveloperGuide.md#architecture).
